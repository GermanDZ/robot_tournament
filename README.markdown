# Robot Tournament

Start the server like this:

    ./bin/server

That starts the tournament engine, where you can host battles between rival teams' robots. Robots are built by programmers and have to conform to a simple protocol:

  * uploaded as zip file
  * zip file contains a single folder in the root from which the robot will take it's name
  * the folder contains an executable file, 'move' which will be called by the tournament engine when the robot needs to make a move

See the features for examples, or the folder 'examples'

Use the following command to create and start a tournament:

    ./bin/create_tournament --name "battle royale" --rounds 5 --duration 10 --game rock_paper_scissors

The idea is to practice and encourage the XP principle of 'release early, release often' by rewarding early competitors with points.


Use the following command to start each round after the time reach zero:

    ./bin/kick
